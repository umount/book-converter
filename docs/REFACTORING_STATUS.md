# Refactoring execution status

## Current phase

P00: completed. Baseline and deterministic fixtures.
P01: in_progress. Typed contracts and composition boundary.
P02–P13: pending. No production behavior has been replaced yet.

## Baseline (2026-09-23)

- Source baseline: d636c5d. Planning documents were uncommitted at implementation start.
- Host: Linux x86_64, Rust 1.94.0, Node 18.20.4, approximately 19 GiB RAM.
- Required releases: Windows x86_64, Linux x86_64, macOS arm64/x86_64.
- Initial release floors: Windows 10 22H2, macOS 13, Ubuntu 22.04-compatible Linux.
  These are product targets, not verified packaged compatibility. Tauri prerequisites
  were checked at https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/; native model/PDF runtimes
  must be tested against these floors in P10/P12. This host does not establish
  Windows/macOS compatibility or the 8 GiB CPU budget.
- `npm run build`: exit 0, TypeScript and Vite production build pass.
- `cargo check --offline --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --all-targets`: exit 0.
- `cargo test --offline --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml --lib`: exit 101,
  239 passed, one failed because session::tests::db_path_for_project_ends_with_progress_db
  writes to the sandbox's read-only application data directory. Rerun with an isolated
  XDG_DATA_HOME; never use actual project data for test writes.
- `cargo fmt --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml -- --check`: exit 1, existing
  formatting drift in book/blocks.rs, book/epub.rs, book/mod.rs, book/parser.rs,
  paths.rs and state/blocks.rs. Keep baseline cleanup separate from domain changes.
- Clippy baseline: exit 0 with --all-targets -- -D warnings.
- Isolated XDG_DATA_HOME=/tmp/book-converter-refactor-tests library rerun: exit 0,
  all 240 tests passed.
- Fixture regeneration: identical manifest hashes on two consecutive runs.

## Implemented

- Deterministic fixture generator in scripts/generate-fixtures.py.
- Synthetic Chinese TXT, FB2 reference, structural EPUB and naturally unsorted
  two-volume CBZ. Manifest records expected counts and SHA-256 hashes.
- Repeated image bytes intentionally represent distinct occurrences/pages.
- No source samples, credentials, settings or existing projects modified/deleted.

## Next executable step

Implement P01 shared typed contracts and a working project-manifest validator.
Plan snapshot committed as a45d990. Baseline formatting drift is recorded, not hidden.

## Evidence rules

No OCR/model benchmarks or native GUI smoke tests have run. No phase is complete
without its acceptance evidence. Automatic manga processing has no manual/model-free
fallback. Keep commits scoped; push only on user request.
